## **1. Web Browser APIs and Their Role in Asynchronous JavaScript**

Web Browser APIs are built-in interfaces provided by the browser that allow JavaScript to perform complex operations outside the main thread.
Examples include **setTimeout**, **fetch**, **DOM Events**, and **Geolocation API**.

When JavaScript encounters an asynchronous task, it delegates the operation to these browser APIs.
Once the task is completed, the API sends a callback or promise result to the **Event Queue**, allowing JavaScript to continue other operations without blocking.

**In short:**
Web Browser APIs enable asynchronous execution by handling time-consuming tasks (like network requests or timers) in the background, ensuring the main thread remains free for other operations.

## **2. Event Loop in JavaScript**

The **Event Loop** is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle **non-blocking asynchronous operations** while being **single-threaded**.

Here’s how it works:

1. The **Call Stack** executes synchronous code line by line.
2. When an asynchronous task (like a timer or API call) completes, its callback moves to the **Callback Queue**.
3. The **Event Loop** continuously checks whether the Call Stack is empty.
4. If it’s empty, it pushes the next task from the Callback Queue (or Microtask Queue for Promises) to the Call Stack for execution.

**In essence:**
The Event Loop ensures JavaScript runs efficiently by managing when asynchronous callbacks are executed, without blocking the main thread.

## **3. Inversion of Control in Callbacks**

**Inversion of Control** occurs when we pass a callback function to another function and depend on it to execute our code correctly.

For example, in older asynchronous code, developers relied heavily on callbacks. The control of “when and how” the function executes lies in the hands of another function or library.

**Why it’s problematic:**

* We lose control over the execution order.
* Error handling becomes difficult.
* It can lead to **Callback Hell**, where multiple nested callbacks make code unreadable and hard to maintain.

**Solution:**
Promises and `async/await` solve this issue by giving back structured control flow and better error handling.

## **4. Promise Chaining**

**Promise Chaining** allows us to perform multiple asynchronous operations **in sequence**, where each operation starts after the previous one completes.

Each `.then()` block returns a new Promise, enabling the next `.then()` to access the result of the previous one.

This makes asynchronous code clean, readable, and avoids deeply nested callbacks.

**Example (Conceptually):**

```
fetchData()
  .then(processData)
  .then(displayData)
  .catch(handleError)
```

Each step runs only after the previous one is resolved.

---

## **5. Errors Inside `.then()` Without `.catch()`**

If an error occurs inside a `.then()` block and there’s **no `.catch()`** attached, the Promise becomes **rejected**, but the error goes **unhandled**.

This leads to:

* A **"UnhandledPromiseRejection" warning** in the console.
* Potential runtime issues because the rejection is never properly caught.

**Best Practice:**
Always attach a `.catch()` at the end of the Promise chain to handle all possible errors gracefully.

## **6. Difference Between `Promise.allSettled()` and `Promise.all()`**

| Feature      | `Promise.all()`                                                  | `Promise.allSettled()`                                                     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Behavior** | Resolves only if all promises succeed; rejects if any one fails. | Resolves after all promises settle (either fulfilled or rejected).         |
| **Use Case** | When all operations must succeed together.                       | When you want results of all operations, regardless of success or failure. |
| **Output**   | Array of resolved values (if successful).                        | Array of objects with status (`fulfilled` or `rejected`) and value/reason. |

**Example Scenario:**
Use `Promise.allSettled()` when multiple independent API calls must be executed, and you need to know which succeeded or failed individually.

## **7. Converting Callback-Based Functions into Promises**

You can **wrap a callback-based asynchronous function** (like `setTimeout`) inside a Promise to make it easier to handle using `.then()` or `async/await`.

This technique is called **Promisification**.

**Conceptually:**

```
function delay(ms) {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}
```

Now you can use:

```
delay(2000).then(() => console.log("Executed after 2 seconds"));
```

This makes callback-style functions compatible with modern Promise-based asynchronous flows.

## **8. Synchronous vs Asynchronous JavaScript**

| Aspect          | **Synchronous JavaScript**                                                | **Asynchronous JavaScript**                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Execution**   | Runs line by line, blocking the next task until the current one finishes. | Non-blocking; allows other code to run while waiting for tasks to complete.       |
| **Performance** | Slower when handling I/O operations or API calls.                         | Faster and more efficient for tasks like fetching data, reading files, or timers. |
| **Use Cases**   | Simple computations or logic flow.                                        | Network requests, file reading, timers, animations, etc.                          |

**Why we need Asynchronous Code:**
Without it, JavaScript would freeze the entire webpage whenever a long task (like fetching data) runs.
Asynchronous code ensures smooth performance and a responsive user experience.

| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web Browser APIs**     | Handle background tasks like timers and network requests.     |
| **Event Loop**           | Manages when asynchronous tasks return to the main thread.    |
| **Inversion of Control** | Loss of control in callbacks; solved by Promises.             |
| **Promise Chaining**     | Runs async tasks sequentially in readable format.             |
| **Unhandled Errors**     | Errors in `.then()` without `.catch()` cause silent failures. |
| **Promise.allSettled()** | Returns all results, unlike `Promise.all()` which fails fast. |
| **Promisification**      | Converts callback functions into Promise-based ones.          |
