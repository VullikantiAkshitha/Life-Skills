## 1. Active Listening

### Definition
**Active Listening** means fully concentrating, understanding, responding, and remembering what is being said.  
It is more than just hearing words; it involves **attention, empathy, and feedback**.

### Steps/Strategies of Active Listening (Minimum 6)

1. **Pay Full Attention**  
   - Focus completely on the speaker.  
   - Avoid distractions (mobile phone, multitasking).  

2. **Show That You’re Listening**  
   - Use body language (nodding, eye contact).  
   - Use short verbal affirmations like “I see,” “Right,” “Got it.”  

3. **Provide Feedback**  
   - Reflect back what you hear.  
   - Example: “So what you’re saying is…” or “Do you mean that…?”  

4. **Defer Judgment**  
   - Don’t interrupt or make assumptions.  
   - Listen fully before responding.  

5. **Respond Appropriately**  
   - Be respectful, open-minded, and clear in your replies.  
   - Don’t jump to giving advice too quickly.  

6. **Ask Clarifying Questions**  
   - If something is unclear, ask for details.  
   - Example: “Could you explain that part again?”  

7. **Remember Key Details**  
   - Summarize important points at the end.  
   - Note down key information (especially in meetings).  

 These steps ensure the conversation is **two-way, empathetic, and effective**.

## 2. Reflective Listening

###  Definition
**Reflective Listening** is a form of **Active Listening** with stronger focus on:  
- Mirroring emotions, body language, and tone  
- Restating and verifying what the speaker has said  
- Ensuring both sides have a **shared understanding**  

It is widely used in **critical situations** (pilots, military), **business meetings**, and **personal relationships**.

---

### Application in Business/Software Context
- Always **take notes** in technical meetings.  
- **Share notes** with all stakeholders (clients, managers, team members).  
- **Verify correctness** by asking: “Did I capture this correctly?”  
- Make sure everyone is **on the same page**.  
- Prevent misunderstandings during implementation.

###  Fisher’s Model – Key Points of Reflective Listening (in simple words)

According to Fisher’s model, **Reflective Listening** has the following key points:

1. **Listen carefully without interrupting** – Give full space to the speaker.  
2. **Restate or paraphrase** – Repeat the speaker’s message in your own words to confirm understanding.  
   - Example: “So what I hear you saying is…”  
3. **Acknowledge emotions** – Recognize the feelings of the speaker.  
   - Example: “It sounds like you’re frustrated with the delay.”  
4. **Ask for confirmation** – Ensure your understanding is correct.  
   - Example: “Am I getting this right?”  
5. **Encourage openness** – Show empathy so the speaker feels safe to share more.  

This model builds **trust, clarity, and shared meaning**.

## 3. Reflection on Listening Habits

### Question 3: What are the obstacles in your listening process?
- **Distractions** – Checking phone or thinking of unrelated tasks.  
- **Prejudgment** – Assuming what the speaker will say before they finish.  
- **Daydreaming** – Mind wandering to other thoughts.  
- **Emotional reactions** – Getting defensive when something disagrees with me.  
- **Multitasking** – Trying to listen while typing or reading.  

---

###  Question 4: What can you do to improve your listening?
- **Practice mindfulness** – Stay present in the conversation.  
- **Take notes** – Helps in remembering details.  
- **Ask clarifying questions** – Avoids misunderstandings.  
- **Control emotions** – Listen fully before reacting.  
- **Summarize back** – End conversations by restating key points.

## 4. Types of Communication

Communication styles differ in how people **express themselves**.  
There are **4 main types**:

### 1. Passive Communication
- Avoiding expressing opinions or needs.  
- Prioritizing others’ needs over your own.  
- Often leads to **bottled-up emotions**.  

**Example:**  
- At work: Not speaking up in meetings even if you have a concern.  
- Personal life: Saying “It’s fine” when it’s not.

---

### 2. Aggressive Communication
- Expressing needs and opinions **forcefully**.  
- Often disrespectful, dominating, or blaming.  
- Can hurt relationships.  

**Example:**  
- At work: Saying “This is a stupid idea!”  
- Personal life: Yelling when angry.

---

### 3. Passive-Aggressive Communication
- Appearing passive but expressing anger in **indirect ways**.  
- Includes sarcasm, gossiping, taunts, silent treatment.  

**Example:**  
- At work: Saying “Sure, I’ll do it” but intentionally delaying.  
- Personal life: Using sarcasm like “Wow, you’re so smart!” (meant negatively).

---

### 4. Assertive Communication
- Expressing needs clearly, confidently, and respectfully.  
- Balanced → not too passive, not too aggressive.  
- Best style for building trust.  

**Example:**  
- At work: “I don’t agree with this approach, but I’d like to suggest an alternative.”  
- Personal life: “I need some time alone right now, let’s talk later.”

### Question 5: When do you switch to Passive communication style?
- When I feel shy or uncomfortable speaking.  
- In group discussions where I fear judgment.  
- When I don’t want to create conflict.  

---

###  Question 6: When do you switch into Aggressive communication style?
- When I’m frustrated or stressed.  
- When I feel my ideas are being ignored.  
- In personal life, when I’m angry and lose patience.  

---

###  Question 7: When do you switch into Passive Aggressive communication style?
- When I’m upset but don’t want to argue openly.  
- Using sarcasm when I feel unheard.  
- Silent treatment during personal conflicts.  

---

###  Question 8: How can you make your communication assertive?

**Steps to apply in life:**
1. **Be clear and direct** – Say exactly what you mean.  
2. **Use “I” statements** – Example: “I feel concerned when deadlines are missed.”  
3. **Control tone and body language** – Calm and respectful.  
4. **Respect others’ views** – Listen before replying.  
5. **Set healthy boundaries** – Say “No” politely when needed.  
6. **Practice confidence** – Speak up in meetings and personal conversations.  

Assertive communication = **Honest + Respectful + Confident**
