Good Practices for Software Development

## Question 1  
**Which point(s) were new to you?**

The points that were new to me:  
- The importance of **over-communicating** in different scenarios (like requirement changes, internet issues, or delays in implementation).  
- Using tools such as **Loom, Github Gists, Codepen, and Codesandbox** to clearly show problems while asking questions.  
- The suggestion to **join meetings 5â€“10 minutes early** to build rapport and have informal conversations with teammates.  
- The reminder to **track time using productivity apps like Boosted** to manage focus better.

## Question 2  
**Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**

I think I need to improve on:  
- **Doing things with 100% involvement and focus** during work.  
- I sometimes get distracted by notifications or multitasking, which reduces my productivity.  

**Ideas to improve:**  
- Put my **phone on silent** and disable non-work notifications.  
- Use **website/app blockers** like Freedom during work hours.  
- Follow the rule: *Work when you work, play when you play*.  
- Track my time daily with a tool like **Boosted** to measure focus.  
- Take short breaks and do light exercise to stay energized and avoid burnout.
